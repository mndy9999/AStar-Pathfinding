# AStar-v2

Implementation of the A* pathfinding algorithm I wrote as part of my Artificial Intelligence module. 

It was implemented by using nodes to represent different positions on the map.

The map can consist of multiple types of terrain, each of them having an associated cost:
  1. Road - move cost 1
  2. Grass - move cost 3
  3. Swamp - move cost 5
  4. Mountain - cannot be traversed
  5. Water - cannot be traversed
